    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Border</h3>
        <b>Traditions of Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire: counties along the border with Wales. Characteristics of the tradition as practised in the 19th and early 20th centuries include: blackface (in some areas), use of either a small strip of bells (in some areas) or no bells at all (in others), costume often consisting of ordinary clothes decorated with ribbons, strips of cloth, or pieces of coloured paper; or sometimes "fancy dress", small numbers of traditional dances in the team repertoire, often only one and rarely more than two, highly variable number of dancers in the set and configurations of the set (some sides had different versions of a dance for different numbers of dancers), and an emphasis on stick dances almost to the exclusion of hankie dances.</b></li>
      <li>
        <h3>Cotswold</h3>
        <b>Traditions from these villages: Abingdon, Adderbury, Ascot-under-Wychwood, Badby, Bampton, Bidford, Bledington, Brackley, Bucknell, Chipping Campden, Ducklington, Eynsham, Headington Quarry, Hinton-in-the-Hedges, Ilmington, Kirtlington, Leafield, Longborough, Oddington, Sherbourne, Stanton Harcourt, Upton-upon-Severn and Wheatley.
        <br>The set dances include handkerchief dances, processional dances, stick dances and hand clapping dances, there are also jigs for one or two dancers. The men will usually wear a white shirt, white trousers or dark breeches and black shoes. Bells are worn below the knee, and the club costume may often be a coloured baldrick or a waistcoat.</b></li>
      <li>
        <h3>North West</h3>
        <b>Tradition is named after the North West region of England and has always featured mixed and female sides, at least as far back as the 18th century.
        <br>Historically, most sides danced in various styles of shoes or boots, although dancing in clogs was also very common. Modern revivalist sides have tended more towards the wearing of clogs.The dances were often associated with rushcarts at the local wakes or holidays, and many teams rehearsed only for these occasions.</b></li>
